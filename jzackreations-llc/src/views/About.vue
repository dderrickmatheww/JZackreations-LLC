          Art has been the platform that I've used to get through all the experiences in my life. Whether those experiences are good or bad I express myself through my art. 
          My logo is a direct representation of that! The heart may seem to be "broken" but it's still held toegther by the pencil & paint brush!
          The red represents life; it represents strength and I'm still thriving through it all. I feel that I have a story to tell & I use my artwork to narrate my story!
